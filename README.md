# Depletion of 3 highly expressed heme miRs from small RNA sequencing libraries using blocking oligos

## Analyzing the effect of a multiplexed pool of blocking oligos on a paired-sample pilot study and a large cohort of samples

This analysis is split into 4 major steps:

1. Effect of blocking oligos on target detection
2. Impact of blocking oligos on global miRNA expression patterns
3. Analysis of off-target effects of blocking oligos
4. Benefits of using blocking oligos during small RNA library construction
